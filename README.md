# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

* Allow users to create profiles where they can share information about their feet, including photos, size, shape, and any other relevant details. This helps users connect with others who have similar preferences or interests.

* mplement robust search and filtering options so users can easily find feet that match their preferences. Filters could include criteria such as size, gender, age, location, and specific features like arch shape or toe length.

* Enable messaging features to facilitate communication between users who are interested in sharing or viewing feet. This could include private messaging, group chats, or forums where users can discuss foot-related topics and arrange meetups.

* Implement verification processes to ensure the authenticity of user profiles and promote a safe environment for users to interact. This could involve verifying user identities, moderating content to prevent inappropriate behavior, and providing reporting tools for users to flag any concerns.

* Offer customizable privacy settings that allow users to control who can view their profiles and content. This might include options to make profiles public, private, or visible only to approved followers. Additionally, consider implementing features like blocking or muting to give users more control over their interactions.# A11-ayesh-client-side
